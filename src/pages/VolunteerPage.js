                    a community service requirement? Or maybe you are just looking for something fun
                    to do one Saturday morning. Whatever you reason, we would love to have you as a
                    volunteer!

                <p> The Brooks Avenue Food Bank & Clothing Closet is a group of dedicated volunteers,
                    who aim to help families in need. We are made up of both church members, as well
                    as others who are just looking to give back. We meet from 9am - 12pm on open days.
                    However, we can also use people during the week to help stock/prepare.
                </p>

                <p> If you are interested in volunteering please contact the office for more information. </p>
