        <div>
            <p> Brooks Avenue Church of Christ is a Raleigh based church that makes community outreach
                a priority. We aim to provide a reliable support system for families in immediate need.
                Our food pantry and clothing closet are staffed entirely by volunteers, including church
                members as well as others. We are a donation based organization and rely primarily on the
                generosity of our community to operate. We are open on the 2nd and 4th Saturdays of most
                moths. A full list of dates can be seen on the calendar.
