                Brooks Avenue Church of Christ is a Raleigh based church that makes community outreach a
                priority. Over the past few years our volunteers have worked to create a reliable
                support system for families in need. We provide assistance with both food and clothing
                from 9AM-12PM on the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Saturday of most months.
